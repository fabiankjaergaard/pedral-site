      <h2>1. About Us</h2>

      </p>

      <h2>2. Scope</h2>
      <p>
        These terms apply to all purchases made through shop.pedral.eu by consumers. They cover
        both in-stock purchases and pre-orders.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Pricing</h2>
      <p>
        Prices in EUR include Swedish VAT (25%) where applicable. For non-EU deliveries, VAT is
        not charged at checkout but import duties/taxes may apply and are the buyer&apos;s
        responsibility.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Ordering &amp; Payment</h2>
      <p>
        Your order constitutes an offer to purchase. Confirmed by email = contract formed.
        Payment via Stripe/Klarna.
      </p>

      <h3>In-Stock Orders</h3>
      <p>
        Full payment is taken at time of order. Your watch ships within 5 business days of order
        confirmation.
      </p>

      <h3>Pre-Orders</h3>
      <p>
        Many Pedral watches are produced in limited editions and may not yet be in stock at the
        time of purchase. When you place a pre-order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full payment is taken at time of order to secure your allocation</li>
        <li>
          The estimated delivery window (typically 4–8 weeks) is clearly stated on the product
          page and in your order confirmation email
        </li>
        <li>
          If production delays exceed the estimated window by more than 30 days, you will be
          notified by email and may cancel for a full refund
        </li>
        <li>
          You may cancel your pre-order at any time before dispatch for a full refund — email{" "}
          <a href="mailto:info@pedral.watch">info@pedral.watch</a> with your order number
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Why we charge upfront:</strong> Each edition is limited to 20 pieces. Payment at
        time of order ensures your allocation is secured and production is committed. This model
        allows us to produce without overstock — aligning with our limited-edition philosophy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under EU law (Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/EU), you have{" "}
        <strong>14 days from the day you receive the goods</strong> to withdraw without giving
        any reason. This applies to both in-stock orders and pre-orders. See full{" "}
        <a href="/withdrawal">Right of Withdrawal</a> page.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Before dispatch:</strong> You may cancel at any time for a full refund. Email{" "}
          <a href="mailto:info@pedral.watch">info@pedral.watch</a> with your order number.

          <strong>After delivery:</strong> The standard 14-day withdrawal period applies from
          the date you receive the watch. Return the watch in its original condition for a full
          refund.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Exception — Made-to-Order</h3>
      <p>
        Goods made to your personal specifications are exempt from the right of withdrawal under
        Art. 16(c) of the Consumer Rights Directive. This applies only to: Triomphe custom Hebrew
        and Eastern Arabic numeral editions produced specifically for the buyer. You will be
        clearly informed at checkout if this exception applies to your order.
      </p>

          For all standard, non-personalised editions (including pre-orders): the 14-day
          withdrawal right applies in full.
