The guilloché dial: a woven Carreau Tissé centre, precision-stamped from a CNC-machined mold, surrounded by satinée circulaire and sauté piqué textures that shift under every light. Les Anneaux Triomphaux — three recessed rings channelling the Arc de Triomphe — frame a flowing Vagues de Lumière moiré border. The stone dial: each one unrepeatable, nature's own fingerprint on your wrist. When a dial edition sells out, it doesn't return.",
